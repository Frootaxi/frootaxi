    <ul>
        <li class="title3">Does my subscription fee cover the cost of the trips I take with Frootaxi cars?</li>
        <li>No, your subscription fee is our service fee which every passenger pays. When making cash payments, you will be required to pay your subscription fee in advance and only pay the cost of the trip (minus our service charge) when you use a Frootaxi car.</li>
        <li class="title3">Do I pay subscription fee only once?</li>
        <li>No, a subscription fee is like buying credits for your mobile number. It gives you a certain number of trips, calculated from the cost of each of those trips. Once you run out of Frootaxi credits, you have to top up again to continue using our service.</li>
        <li class="title3">Do I need to pay subscription fee if I have chosen cashless payments (pay through my bank account or mobile money account) as my payment preference?</li>
        <li>No, you however can choose a payment plan to receive the free ride offers.</li>
        <li class="title3">Is it safe to connect my bank account to the system?</li>
        <li>We currently do not accept direct access to your bank accounts but rather encourage you to connect through a third party service such as MPower. With this platform your credit card or bank account details are kept hidden and only charges made will be deducted.</li>
        <li class="title3">Why do I need to check the taxi driver’s details against my confirmation SMS message?</li>
        <li>Frootaxi cannot guarantee that the driver picking you up is the driver registered to the mobile number and taxi cab in our system. So we ask all passengers to check before sitting in to ensure their safety and a licence approved taxi driver.</li>
